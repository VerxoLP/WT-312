# WT-312, a MK-312 style driver on a stick!
## About:
This project aims to bring the hardware of e-stim/TENS to an easy-to-use module. Think: Sparkfun, Adafruit, DFRobot, etc.
I build this project with the main goal of interfacing to an ESP32 processor so many of the documentation or some design decissions will be made towards this processor. But you should be able to use your own favorite MCU.

## NodeMCU32s example:
This is an example on how to connect the WT-312 module to the ESP32. This configuration will work with the provided example firmware.
